//This algorithm works for both the directed and undirected weighted graphs 
//and can handle graphs with both positive and negative weight edges.
//‼️Note: It does not work for the graphs with negative cycles 
//(where the sum of the edges in a cycle is negative).
//📍using optimal substructure property
//📍better for Dense Graphs and not for Sparse Graphs because of O(V^3)
